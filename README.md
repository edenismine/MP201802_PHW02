# Simple Mock-up chat app that uses the Template and Observer design patterns

## Background

This mock-up/application is based on the following specification:

> You’ve been asked to create a chat app that’ll have users from three
> different countries: Spain, Mexico and the UK. All users have a name
> to identify themselves with (for simplicity, suppose they all use
> different names and won’t try to use a name that’s already been
> taken). Every time a new user joins the chat all other members are
> notified with a message that corresponds to their country of origin a
> spanish member, for example, will receive something like “Habéis
> conseguido un nuevo compañero”, a mexican member will receive a
> different message that is more suited for their region and a british
> member will receive a message in English. All users will be notified
> when one of them sends a message, and everyone will be able to read
> it. Lastly, if a user leaves the chat, the remaining users will be
> notified.

It was developed as part of the activities of the 2018 Modeling and
Programming course taught by Prof. Rosa Victoria Villa Padilla at the
[Science Faculty](http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/) of the [National
Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/).

### Observer pattern

According to Freeman and Sierra’s [book on design
patterns](https://g.co/kgs/ycnzMg):

> The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
> so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
> notified and updated automatically.

### Template pattern

According to Freeman and Sierra’s [book on design
patterns](https://g.co/kgs/ycnzMg):

> The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a
> method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets
> subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
> algorithm’s structure.
